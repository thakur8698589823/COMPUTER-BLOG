                  noticedthatthey
                  visit some sites that you don’t like. Like some download sites, Youtube and other sites that consume
                  much data. You can easily block any site from your computer using this awesome computer trick.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  hold the windows key + letter R, the Run box appears. <br>

                  Type in this code <b>%windir%\system32\drivers\etc </b>in the Run box and hit the Enter key.This will
                  open
                  the
                  etc folder.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  This etc folder contains a file called Host and some other files. We are interested in the Host file
                  here.
                  <br><br>
                  But getting to the host file through the above step will not give you access to save your settings
                  at
                  the end of the day, I just want you to see the folder before following the right step.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Click Start and search for notepad, right click on Notepad and select Run as administrator.
                  <br><br>
                  Look at the taskbar on notepad click on <b> File>Open>This Pc>Local Disk
                    C:>Windows>system32>driver>etc</b>
                  When you get to this etc folder, at the bottom of notepad open box change the Text Documents drop
                  <br><br>
                  Double click on Host and type the following code at the bottom of the page
                  <br><br>
                  127.0.0.2 website you want to block <br>
                  127.0.0.3 www.website you want to block <br>

                  127.0.0.5 www.another website you want to block <br><br>

                <p class="para">If you share your computer with family members or coworkers, you’re going to want each
                  of them to have
                  their own login. Each user gets their own desktop layout, their own set of data folders and their own
                  Start menu. You can also create child accounts that restrict what websites and apps your kids can use,
                  while reporting all of their activity to you. Here’s how to add adult users, parents and children in
                  Windows 10. <br> <br>
                  Navigate to Settings. You can get there from the Start menu and click Accounts. <br><br>
                  Click Family & Other Users in the left window pane. <br> <br>
                  Click “Add a family member” or “Add someone else to this PC.” Choose “family member” if you are either
                  adding a child or adding an adult who needs access to parental control settings for child users. If no
                  children are using this computer, using “Add someone else . . ” should be fine.

                  If you want one of your adult users, whether they are a parent or not, to be able to install desktop
                  software, change settings or add other users, you will need to give them admin permissions.<br> <br>
                  Open control panel. You can get there by hitting Windows + X and selecting control panel.<br> <br>
                  Open the User Accounts menu and click Manage another account.<br> <br>
                  Select the account you wish to give admin rights to.<br> <br>
                  Click “Change the account type.”<br> <br>
                  Select Administrator and click the Change Account Type button.

                  Enter the person’s email address and click Next.This address should be tied to the person’s Microsoft
                  account.<br> <br>

                  How to Add a Child<br> <br>
                  Click “Add a Family Member and then Select “Add a Child.”<br> <br>
                  Enter the child’s Microsoft account email address. If they don’t have a Microsoft account, you must
                  sign
                  them up for one. If your child is too young to have an email address and you click “The person I want
                  to
                  add doesn’t have an email address,” you will be prompted to create a Microsoft account and
                  corresponding
                  @outlook.com email address for them. It’s unfortunate that Microsoft requires child accounts to have
                  email, but parents can use their own email address or create a dummy one. <br> <br>
                  Click <b> Confirm</b>.<br> <br>
                  Click Close. The child’s email account will get an invite.<br> <br>

                  <br>
                  Click Add a Family Member and then Select Adult, enter the email address and click Next. The email
                  account should be tied to the new user’s Microsoft account.
                  Click Confirm.<br> <br>
                  The person will receive an email invitation and have to confirm it.

                  upgraded to a new
                  version of Windows at some point, then a significant portion of your previous operating system’s files
                  are likely still sitting on your hard drive in a folder named Windows.old. Deleting these files can
                  free
                  up some precious space.<br> <br>
                  How to delete Windows.old in Windows 10, 8 or 7.<br> <br>
                  Please follow the steps below to delete Windows.old in Windows 10, 8 or 7.<br> <br>
                  Enter the following text in the Windows search field, located in the lower left-hand corner of your
                  screen or accessible via the Start Menu button in older operating system versions: disk cleanup<br>
                  <br>
                  Click on the Disk Cleanup option, if necessary.<br> <br>
                  The Disk Cleanup application should now appear, overlaying your desktop. Click the Clean up system
                  files
                  button.
                  There will be a brief delay at this point, as Disk Cleanup analyzes your hard drive and calculates how
                  much space it might be able to clear up. The length of this delay will vary based on the size of your
                  drive and the amount of files currently stored on it.<br> <br>

                  Once scanning and analysis is complete, the main Disk Cleanup window will re-appear with new options
                  listed in the Files to delete: section. Locate the option labeled Previous Windows installation(s).
                  This
                  might be labeled Older versions of Windows instead, depending on your operating system. Place a check
                  mark next to this option by clicking on its accompanying check box once.
                  <br> <br>
                  Remove the check marks next to other items in the list, unless you want to remove those from your hard
                  drive as well.
                  <br> <br>
                  Click on the OK button to initiate the deletion process. Once complete, Windows.old and its contents
                  should be completely removed from your PC.

                <p class="para">You know that they are a lot of factors to be considered when it comes to internet
                  speed.There are
                  basically internal and external factors.Apart from your connections like cable, modem etc, you don’t
                  have access to external factors.With this trick, you can boost the internet speed of your computer.
                  Let
                  get started.
                  <br><br>
                  Open Command Prompt as administrator. <br><br>
                  Type in this code netsh int tcp show global press the Enter key
                  <br><br>
                  Open notepad and paste the following codes then save the document anything you want but make sure it
                  ends with .bat. Save it on the desktop.
                  <br> cd\
                  netsh int tcp show global <br>
                  netsh int tcp set global chimney=enabled <br>
                  netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled <br>
                  netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal <br>
                  netsh int tcp set global congestionprovider=ctcp <br> <br>
                  The above code will just change the tcp settings you see in the command prompt output.
                  Remember to save with .bat extension.<br> <br>
                  Run the file as an administrator and instantly you will see an increase in internet speed.

                  <br> <br>If you want to change these TCP settings to their default, paste the code below into notepad
                  and save it with .bat extension.
                  Maybe something like reset.bat<br> <br>
                  cd\<br>
                  netsh int tcp show global<br>
                  netsh int tcp set global chimney=default<br>
                  netsh int tcp set heuristics enabled<br>
                  netsh int tcp set global congestionprovider=none<br><br>
                  This will return the tcp settings on your computer back to default.

                <p class="para">Tethering your phone to your Windows 10 device is a simple process and can save you a
                  ton of
                  headaches.Tethering is the process of sharing your phone’s mobile data to access the internet on other
                  devices, like a laptop. You can also tether using a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection, but USB Tethering
                  is
                  the fastest and most effective way to share your phone’s mobile data with other devices. That said, it
                  generally won’t give you the types of speeds a solid Wi-Fi connection can. <br><br>
                  How to Set Up USB Tethering<br><br>
                  The process for setting up USB tethering is pretty streamlined on newer devices.
                  <br><br>
                  Connect your mobile device to your laptop through a USB cable connection. For most Android phones,
                  this
                  will use a USB-to-Micro USB cable. Apple phones will use the standard lightning cable.
                  <br><br>
                  Go to your phone’s settings and access your Wi-Fi/Network settings. The menu you will need to access
                  could be listed under a few different options:
                  <br><br>
                  On Android: Open Settings, then tap More Networks > Tethering and on iOS: Open Settings, tap Personal
                  Hotspot.

                  <br><br> On Android, tap the checkbox next to USB Tethering to enable it. On iOS, tap the Personal
                  Hotspot toggle to enable it.
                  Your laptop should be able to access the internet through your phone’s mobile plan. To check if
                  everything is working the way it should open your computer’s Network Settings once everything is
                  tethered. When listing the available networks you should see the enabled network listed as “Remote
                  NDIS
                  based Internet Sharing Device,” or your device’s name.

                  you need and how
                  to set it up.Using your Windows 10 laptop or tablet’s built-in webcam, Hello uses facial recognition
                  to
                  get you in and working in under two seconds. It also works with more than a dozen apps like DropBox,
                  iHeartRadio and OneDrive, so you can skip typing in a password. Unfortunately, not every webcam will
                  work with Windows Hello. Your PC will need an infrared (IR) camera to use the feature, which are more
                  common in new laptops and two-in-ones from the past couple years, including those from Dell, Lenovo
                  and
                  Asus.It’s really cool, and it works really well. If you have the right hardware, here’s how you can
                  set
                  up Windows Hello’s face login:<br><br>
                  Open Settings and choose Accounts<br><br>.
                  Click “Sign-in options” on the sidebar and scroll down to Windows Hello. Click “Set up” under Face but
                  if you don’t have a PIN, you’ll need to set that up first. That’s located directly above Windows
                  Hello.
                  <br><br>
                  Click Get Started and Enter your PIN.<br><br>
                  Stare into the webcam while Windows Hello scans your face. This procedure will be quick.
                  <br><br>
                  Click Improve Recognition for additional scans, or close the setup process. If you wear glasses or a
                  hat, we recommend that you scan your face with and without them on.
                  <br><br>
                  The next time you log in to Windows, the camera will be searching for your face.

                  computer shutdown.
                  <br><br>
                  Open you CMD and type shutdown -s -t 30 in this 30 is the number of seconds you will wait before your
                  computer shutdown and it is a variable ie you can put any number you want.

                  How to shutdown a remote computer Using Command Prompt
                  <br><br>
                  The code is shutdown -s -m\\Computer Name.
                  <br><br>
                  You should know that Computer Name is the name of the computer you want to shutdown.
                  <br><br>
                  You view the names of the computers you are connected to by typing net view in the command prompt
                  window.
                  <br><br>
                  Before you can shutdown a remote computer, you must have admin previlage on that computer.
                  <br><br>
                  If you are not sure about that then open Run box, type the computer name and hit enter.
                  <br><br>
                  Know that the login details username/password will be required if you can connect to the system.
                  <br><br>
                  If you can provide the login details then you will see the directories of the system which is the
                  confirmation that you can shutdown the system remotely.

                  account. This
                  happens so that you can always get instant notifications when someone sends you a message or calls
                  you.
                  When you disable Skype on startup, you have to manually open it the first time you want to use it
                  after
                  starting your computer. Once it’s open, it will remain open like normal — and messages and calls can
                  come in — until you sign out or close it down. The procedures we outline below work for current
                  versions
                  of Skype running on Windows 10, Windows 8, and macOS. Skype for Windows 10 and for Windows 8 can be
                  configured to stop starting automatically with Windows. However, depending on how you installed the

                <p class="para">USB flash drives are great backup tool used to store and transfer their data. Sometimes,
                  files on your
                  USB drive may be corrupted or you accidentally deleted your files. Today we are going to show you how
                  to
                  recover deleted files from USB drive.<br><br>
                  <u>Reasons for USB data loss</u><br><br>
                  1) Another program deleted the file.<br>
                  2) Mistakenly or intentionally deleted the file from the USB drive.
                  <br>
                  3) Unplugged USB drive during transfer process.<br>
                  4) File corruption due to virus attacks.<br>
                  5) Fragmented partition structure on the USB flash drive.
                  <br><br>
                  Deleted files on the USB drive cannot be restored in the Recycle Bin unlike files deleted from the
                  local
                  disk/disk drive.<br><br>
                  Use a Data Recovery Tool to recover files from the USB drive
                  <br><br>
                  You can use data recovery tools as well to recover deleted files from your USB drive. Recovery tools
                  are
                  computer programs which are used to recover permanently deleted files on your Windows PC. There are
                  several recovery tools in the computer world, some of which are free and others are largely premium.
                  However, these tools scan your USB drive using an efficient algorithm and recover deleted files and
                  folders on your USB drive. We strongly recommend you SysTools Pen Drive Recovery in order to perform
                  this action. This tool will recover corrupted and deleted videos, images, documents and music files.
                  But
                  this is not the only feature it has. You will be able to recover files from exFAT, FAT, and NTFS,
                  recover your data with its initial attributes, recover data not only from your USB drive but also from
                  memory cards and pen drives.<br><br>
                  Use Command Prompt to recover hidden files from USB<br><br>
                  The simplest way to recover deleted files from a USB drive is to use Command Prompt. Command Prompt is
                  a
                  Windows application available in all Windows Operating System.
                  <br><br>
                  Plug your USB drive (where the files were deleted from), and then press Windows and “R” keys to launch
                  the Run Program.<br><br>
                  >> Type “cmd” and hit “Enter” key to open Command Prompt window.
                  <br>
                  >> In the Command Prompt window, type chkdsk H: /f and hit “Enter” key (Replace H with the drive
                  letter
                  of
                  the USB drive). <br>
                  >> Now, type Y and hit the “Enter” key to proceed letter) and hit the “Enter” key.
                  <br>
                  >> Type H (replace H with the USB drive again.
                  <br>
                  >> Finally, type H:>attrib -h -r -s /s /d *.* and hit the Enter key (Replace H with the drive letter
                  of
                  the
                  USB drive).
                  <br><br>
                  Wait for the process to be completed.<br><br>
                  After this procedure, you will find all deleted files on a newly created folder on your USB drive. But
                  you can change the file extension back to a normal format so as to make those found files functional
                  again. However, ensure you replace “E” with the drive letter of the USB drive in steps 3 and 6 above.
                  You can also try out this fix on your SD, HD, or another external storage device.
