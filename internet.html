                        <p class="para">Facebook is, undoubtedly, the most popular social networking website with more than 500 million active
                            users. Due to its popularity, many hackers (or should I say crackers?) are actively involved in hacking
                            Facebook accounts of unsuspecting users. This article outlines the many strategies that such hackers use
                            to gain access to Facebook accounts of hundreds of users each day and how you can stop them from hacking
                            your account.<br><br>

                            Facebook is one of the prime target of hackers!<br><br>
            
                            <b> Email Address Hack</b> <br>
                            I have always been puzzled by Facebook’s leniency in this matter. All a hacker needs to do is know your
                            name and he will be conveniently shown your email address at your profile. How easily a hacker can then
                            hack your Facebook account (and everything else associated with that email id) if he ‘guesses’ your
                            password (if you use a weak password) or answers your security question! This is something I hope
                            Facebook improves on quickly. Until Facebook does so, here are some tricks you can use to protect
                            yourself from this vulnerability.<br><br>
            
                            <b> How to safeguard your Email Address?</b> <br>
                            Just follow these steps:-<br><br>
                            Hide your Email Address from everyone by going to Edit Profile>Contact Information>Clicking on the icon
                            beside your email address> checking ‘Only Me’.<br><br>
                            Change your primary email address to a one that is only known to you by going to Account Settings>Email>
                            and changing your primary email to the new one (known only to you) and removing your previous email
                            address.<br><br>
                            For additional security, when in Account Settings, check ‘Secure browsing’ and ‘Send me an email when a
                            new computer or mobile device logs into this account’ and click Save.

                            <b> A hacker at work! <br>
                                Phishing</b><br>
                            Phishing is one of the easiest ways to trick users into giving out their login credentials. All a hacker
                            does is setup a webpage similar in design to that of the Facebook homepage, attach a server sided script
                            to track the username and password entered and store it in a log. Sending people emails stating that
                            someone tagged a photo of them on Facebook in the same format as Facebook and giving a link below to the
                            phishing website further reduces the chances of it being detected as a fake. Sometimes, spam Facebook
                            apps, like those promising to tell who viewed your Facebook profile, automatically post links to
                            phishing websites. A new trend amongst phishers is creating Facebook look-a-like widgets for stealing
                            user’s login credentials.<br><br>
            
                            <b> How to prevent yourself from being phished?</b> <br>
                            At all costs, avoid clicking on suspicious links. Moreover, always check the URL in the address bar
                            before signing in. Avoid logging in through various “Facebook widgets” offered by websites and blogs.
                            Instead, use Facebook’s homepage to sign in. Always try to use Safe Search while searching. If you do
                            manage to get phished, report the website so that others may get a warning before visiting it.

                            computer system by a cracker to record all the activity that is going on the victim’s computer.
                            Keylogging gets more easy if the hacker has physical access to the victim’s computer.

                            <b> How to stop keyloggers? </b> <br>
                            Install a good antivirus and update it frequently. Do not click on suspicious links and avoid
                            downloading illegal software. Also, avoid installing free toolbars and other such spam software. Always
                            scan third-person’s flash and pen drives before using them on your computer.

                            <b> Social Engineering</b> <br>
                            Social engineering involves using any trick to fool the user into making himself vulnerable to exploits.
                            This could involve anything from sending spoof emails, pretending to be from Facebook, telling you to
                            change your password to 12345678 to a hacker maliciously getting out the answer to your security
                            question in a friendly chat or discussion.<br><br>
            
                            <b> How to prevent yourself from being socially engineered?</b>
                            <br>
                            Stay aware during chats and discussions. Use a tough security question, preferably one whose answer you
                            would never disclose to anyone. Moreover, Facebook, or any other company for that matter, will never ask
                            you to change your password to 12345678 or do something as silly as asking you to send out your login
                            details to prove that you are an active user. Always think before taking actions and your e-life on
                            Facebook will be safe from hackers looking to hack Facebook accounts

                            Social networks are no exception for such malicious activity. Recently, millions of accounts from
                            LinkedIn and eHarmony were compromised. Facebook seeing danger has updated its security and is advising
                            its users regarding various scams and how to fight them back.<br><br>
            
                            <b> Facebook Scams <br>
                                1.‘Please send money scam’</b> <br>
                            An unknown account sends a message stating that he/she has been mugged. Descriptions of events seem
                            accurate including real names and places. Finally, the sender requests a certain sum, which will enable
                            him/her to return home safely. <br>
                            Facebook has attributed such scams as ‘Please send money scams’. The sender’s account is either fake or
                            has been taken over by cyber criminals. On receiving ‘please send money scam’ messages, Facebook advices
                            to report/block the account.<br><br>
            
                            <b> 2. Phishing </b> <br>
                            Phishing is a common way to to hack account(s). Phishing links are sent within messages or through
                            chats. <br><br>
                            Phishing links through messages:<br><br>
                            A message, which has scrambled words with funny fonts, is the first indication of a Phishing attack.
                            Typo errors and misspelled words are other significant signs to look for. Such messages will be themed
                            around offering gifts such as coins, jewels or any other artifacts. Finally, you will be asked to click
                            on a link placed at the bottom of the message. Immediately report accounts who send such messages.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Phishing links in chats: </b> <br>
                            If any strange links appear while chatting, then beware. The account through which phished links
                            appeared while chatting is probably compromised. Report the link immediately. However, doing so will not
                            affect the account. Only the link will be considered for review by Facebook’s security team.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> What to do if I had clicked on Phishing link accidentally?</b> <br>
                            If accidentally, a phishing link is clicked, go to password settings in your profile and change your
                            password immediately. This will eliminate any Phishing threat. It is important to ensure that your new
                            password is hard to crack.

                            <b> Malicious Script Scam</b><br>
                            Often you will come across Facebook applications requesting to copy a certain script and paste it in
                            your browser. Such scripts are malicious in nature. For instance, some applications will provide a list
                            of your profile visitors when the script is pasted in your browser. Apart from showing recent visitors,
                            these applications send events and messages to your friend list. These applications and scripts should
                            be avoided. A screenshot of one such application is shown below:

                            Occasionally, some emails will request to reset your password, give a warning or will be about
                            notifications. These mails are so convincing that they appear to be from Facebook. A request to click at
                            the link provided at the bottom of the message should alert you. To check the validity of the link,
                            right click and copy it. Later paste it on a separate tab and make sure that the URL starts as
                            www.facebook.com. <br>
                            Note: Facebook will never request your password through emails.

                            <b> Suspicious Notifications:</b> <br>
                            Never click on links within suspicious notifications. For instance, you will receive a notification
                            stating that you had requested a password reset albeit you never had requested. Other suspicious
                            notifications include the ones notifying you of registration of a new Facebook account. With the help of
                            your email provider, mark these mails as spam. <br>
                            Cyber criminals are on the rise. It is your responsibility to safeguard your Facebook account. Next time
                            you are using Facebook, be extra cautious.

                            There are three ways in which you can do this. Either, you can customize each wall post’s or photo’s

                            You can even hide a photo from specific people or a list of people. This will be especially useful in

                            something similar. Normally, when someone is tagged in a photo, every friend of that Facebook user gets
                            to know about it. So, if you chose to make a photo visible to friends and someone is tagged in that
                            picture, all their friends will see that image. To prevent this, uncheck the Friends of those tagged

                            2 step process and involves customizing the audience for your past posts as well as those you will make

                            however, change this according to your needs; but for most people, friends would be the best option. You
                            can further improve your privacy by selecting Custom and then unchecking the check box that appears next
                            to “Friends of those tagged”. This will customize your Facebook settings to show your Facebook activity
                            only to your friends and those tagged.
                            <br><br>You can also select who gets tagged in your content to further prevent your content from
                            appearing in front of unwanted eyes. To do this, go to your Privacy Settings from the Settings icon
                            located at the top right of the blue Facebook bar. Then, in Privacy Settings, click on Timeline and

                            requests. Such things have prompted users to come back for more and what many aren’t aware of is the
                            fact that they are vulnerable to online predators and criminals.
                            <br><br>So what should you do to help protect yourself from the bad guys out there? Here are just some
                            helpful
                            things that can help you in the long run if you follow them religiously:
                            <br><br>
                            <b> 1. Understand how the security feature works on Facebook.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            As you are well aware, Facebook is known for periodically modifying its security settings. You will
                            observe posts from the site of the changes being made with regards to its security features that lets
                            other users see content that you don’t want them to view. It’s critical that you look into this
                            carefully and see if the changes can significantly affect you in some way.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> 2. Don’t reveal too much information on Facebook.</b>
                            One of the most obvious ways of getting in trouble within the biggest social networking site is by
                            revealing too much information on just about everything (including yourself). You should be aware of the
                            things that you’re sharing, be it your profile, wall posts, messages and even the content that you share
                            such as pictures and videos. You’ll never know, criminals would use whatever it is you post for their
                            own evil means.<br><br>
                            <b> 3. Pay attention to links, e-mails or friends</b>
                            Social networking sites these can be penetrated by online criminals who use sites like Facebook to gain
                            information about you. This can occur through a sent or posted link, which will in turn eject a virus or
                            spyware to retrieve personal information about you. If you happen to receive a link that you find
                            suspicious, ask your friends about it or simply delete it.
                            <br><br>With the evolution of technology, cyber criminals are more smarter than ever. If you are
                            constantly
                            paying attention for any suspicious activity that comes your way, you can shield yourself from identity
                            theft and other online criminal acts.

                        <p class="para"> Google’s engineers love to hide some pretty cool tricks at the most unexpected places. Add to that
                            Google’s policy of giving 20% of working time to its engineers to do what they want, and you have a
                            search engine filled with lots of entertaining Easter eggs and tricks.
                            <br><br> Sadly, most of these tricks are still a secret, but every now and then, Google employees leak
                            these cool
                            insider pranks and the whole world gets to know about them. Here, I have created a list of all such
                            known Google tricks and Easter eggs that are still “working.”
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Google in 1998</b>
                            <br>
                            Search Google for “Google in 1998” and you will be taken to the past to a search results page that shows
                            how Google looked in 1998.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Kerning</b>
                            <br>
                            Kerning means adjusting the spacing between characters. So, how would you expect Google to describe it?
                            Literally, off course. When you search Google for Kerning, the spacing of the word Kerning is changed as
                            compared to that of other words. This only works with personalized results disabled.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Conway’s Game Of Life</b>
                            <br>
                            Conway’s Game Of Life is a game that indicates how cellular life evolves based on the initial
                            configuration. If you search Google for Conway’s Game of Life, you will get a results page with the game
                            running in the background.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Jason Isaacs</b> <br>
                            Just search for Jason Isaacs and Google will return a page saying Hello to him. This only works on
                            Google UK. This is a reference to Kermode and Mayo’s Film reviews which greets Jason with hello every
                            week.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Bacon Number {Actor Name}</b> <br>
            
                            Kevin Bacon is a famous hollywood actor who was quoted as saying that he has worked with everybody in
                            hollywood or somebody who has worked with them in 1994. This led to many websites being launched about
                            his claim in 2007. Bacon seeing this immense response launched a charitable website called Six Degrees,
                            which is based on a theory that everyone in hollywood has worked with Kevin Bacon through a chain of six
                            acquaintances or less. An actor gets as many degrees as he is distant from Kevin Bacon’s movies in terms
                            of people in the chain of acquaintances. <br><br>
                            Google too has now involved Six Degrees of Bacon in its search results. For example, searching Google
                            for Bacon Number Johnny Depp gives Depp’s Bacon number to be 2.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Google knows how to celebrate the holidays</b> <br>
                            Searching Google for a holiday will make Google return a page decorated with items representing that
                            holiday. For example, searching Google for Christmas returns a page decorated with Christmas lights.
                            This also works for Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Halloween and Festivus. These Easter Eggs based on a festival are
                            only activated when that festival is near.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Zerg Rush</b> <br>
                            Search Google for Zerg Rush and you will see the O’s of Google attacking the search results page. They
                            will attacking every result one by one. There is a health bar which indicates how injured a search
                            result is. You can also kill these O’s by clicking on them. They also have health bars which indicates
                            their health. You get points on the basis of how many O’s you kill. The aim of this game is to beat as
                            many O’s as possible.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Askew or Tilt</b> <br>
                            Ever had the chance of searching Google for Askew or Tilt? If you have, then you already know what comes
                            up. If you haven’t, do it now and you will see the search results page literally tilt to give you a
                            better idea of what these words mean. This will work only if you use latest browsers which support HTML5
                            and CSS3. So, Internet Explorer users, use Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari for a while to use this.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Do a barrel roll</b> <br>
                            ‘Do a barrel roll’ in its true sense means to do a 360 degree spin. Google takes practical
                            demonstrations way too seriously for this one and literally spins the search results page to give you a
                            clearer idea of the meaning of this phrase. Don’t believe me? Go search Google for Do a barrel roll now
                            and see your world turn around.<br><br>
                            This Easter egg is apparently a tribute to Star Fox, a video game series developed by Nintendo, because
                            searching Google for Z or R Twice also does the barrel roll, just like in Star Fox. Many bloggers
                            interpreted a lot of different things from this, but Google clarified that this fun trick was created by
                            a Google Engineer solely for the purpose of entertaining users along with showing the power of new HTML5
                            and CSS3 technologies. Like the previous Easter egg, this will only work in modern browsers.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal Number systems</b> <br>
                            Another one of those literal Google Easter eggs. If you search Google for “Binary”, “Octal” or
                            “Hexadecimal” (without quotes) with Search Plus Your World disabled, Google will show the number of
                            results in the same number system. For example, searching Google for hexadecimal will return the number
                            of results like in the image below.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Recursion</b> <br>
                            The “Did you mean?” feature of Google often helps many users to get to the right results when they type
                            something different from what they intended to search. If you search Google for recursion, the same
                            feature takes you to an endless loop of clicks all linking to the same results page thereby completing
                            recursion, which occurs when something calls itself. Seriously geeky.

                        <p class="para"> Google is the search engine of choice for most users. This is well represented by the fact that Google
                            averages one billion unique visitors every month. A reason for this popularity is Google’s
                            characteristic to integrate simplicity with usability.
                            <br><br>
                            Another major reason for this popularity is Google’s minimalistic homepage, which consists of a search
                            bar and two buttons, Search and I’m Feeling Lucky. We all know what the search button does, it takes us
                            to a search results page consisting of top ten results that match our query. The “I’m Feeling Lucky”
                            button on the other hand takes you to the top ranking page in the search results for a particular query.
                            <br><br>
                            Some webpages use this behavior to create some amazing and funny results. Here is a list of few such
                            keywords that have some funny websites at the first position in Google. To use these tricks, open
                            Google’s homepage, type in the phrase and hit the I’m feeling lucky button. To use the I’m feeling lucky
                            button, you have to disable Google Instant.

                            <b>   Google Gravity</b> <br>
                            The force of gravity is non-existent in cyber space. Google gravity makes you realize how Google would
                            have been if gravity had been effective on the internet as well. Just type Google gravity in the search
                            bar and press the I’m feeling lucky button. This will take you to the Google gravity page which, at
                            first look, might appear to be the Google homepage itself. Wait for a few seconds and you will realize
                            why this Chrome experiment is called Google gravity. Although the website lists it as a Chrome
                            experiment, it works on Mozilla Firefox as well, although it does not work on IE8 and previous versions
                            of IE.

                            Want to see images on Google dance in circular motion? Google sphere is the phrase for that. This phrase
                            will take you to the Google sphere Chrome experiment. Google sphere is a modified version of Image
                            search that adds a bit of fun to your regular search. This Chrome experiment, just like the previous
                            one, works on Chrome, Firefox and IE9.

                            Epic Google will take you to a growing version of Google that will continue to increase in size until it
                            becomes too large to read.

                            Remember the Facebook Pirate language trick? Google too has their own pirate version to compete with
                            that of Facebook’s. Just use the Google Pirate phrase or directly head over to Google Pirate.

                            <b>   Google Rainbow</b> <br>
                            This phrase will take you to a Google search homepage in which each element changes its color rapidly to
                            create the rainbow effect. The search result page obtained for queries is very annoying too as it
                            contains a very loud color combination of red, blue and green.
                            Annoying Google <br>
                            Want to get annoyed while searching on Google? This one is for you. This phrase will take you to a
                            Google search homepage with each word having alternate capital and small letters making everything a bit
                            too hard to read.

                            <b>  2204355</b> <br>
                            Are you already familiar with the age old internet prank called rick-rolling and want to discover
                            something new? Chicken rolling is for you. Try this new way of trapping unsuspecting internet users by
                            typing the code 2204355 in the Google search box and hitting the “Lucky button.”

                            Type in LOL Limewire in Google and you will be taken to a .swf file claiming that you are a pirate and
                            telling you to “do what you want cause a pirate is free.” Funny!

                            This one is for all fans of Chuck Norris jokes. We all know that you don’t find Chuck Norris, he finds

                        <p class="para">What a week this has been for this tech blog! I finally moved it from blogspot subdomain to a custom domain. I have been wanting to do this since a long time (ever since this blog started getting some attention), I somehow couldn’t manage to do so because of the fear of losing search traffic.
                            <br><br> Google’s recent move to redirect blogspot.com to country specific sub domains helped me solidify my decision to the extent of finally moving. I made a lot of other changes as well and have listed as much of them as possible as they might help some of you who are also planning to make the move. I have listed them in the order in which I made them.
                            <br><br>1) Registered TweakAndTrick.com. 
                            <br><br>
                            2) Changed my domain’s settings to hide personal information from being displayed in the who is database.
                            <br><br>
                            3) Modified my domain’s CNAME and A records to correctly point to Google’s servers. Check this page from Blogger for details regarding this step.
                            <br><br>
                            4) Generally, it takes some time for your domain registrar to completely update the settings mentioned above. So, if you immediately point your new domain to your blog, users will see a 404 error. To avoid this, I created a new blogspot blog and modified its settings to point to my new domain.
                            <br><br>
                            5) When my domain correctly started loading the temporary blog, I modified this blog’s settings to link it to the new domain. Now my new domain was correctly loading my blog. While doing this, I made sure to select redirecting the non www version to the www one.
                            <br><br>
                            6) Downloaded my blog’s template and opened the downloaded XML file in Wordpad. I then used Wordpad’s Find and Replace function to replace each occurrence of tweakandtrick.blogspot.com with www.tweakandtrick.com and uploaded the modified template. This automatically changed all navigational links to use the new domain.
                            <br><br>
                            7) Some widgets still had links pointing to the blogspot subdomain. I changed them manually.
                            <br><br>
                            8) Went to Google Webmaster Tools, added my new domain and submitted the full sitemap. Normal Blogger feeds show only 20 URLs, so in order to submit all the URLs, I submitted a custom queried feed that includes 500 URLs.
                            Normal Feed: /atom.xml	
                            Feed I Submitted: /atom.xml?redirect=false&orderby=updated&max-results=500
                            <br><br>
                            9) Bing also brings considerable amount of traffic to this blog. So, I added the new domain to Bing Webmaster Tools and submitted the same sitemap.
                            <br><br>
                            10) Blogspot uses 301 permanent redirects to redirect visitors to new domains. This should have normally allowed Google to immediately index my new blog’s URLs but it did not. So, I resubmitted my old blog’s complete sitemap in Google Webmaster Tools. As the Blogspot blog had some authority in Google, GWT quickly processed the sitemap and immediately noticed that all those posts had moved to the new domain. This notified Google to index my content under the new domain and after almost 12 hours, my old blogspot URL’s started getting replaced by the new ones.
                            <br><br>
                            11) Notified readers of the move on Facebook and Twitter.
                            <br><br>
                            12) After making the move, my search traffic is way lower than normal. This should change and traffic should return to normal once search engines completely transfer my Blogspot subdomain’s trust and authority to this new one.
