                            able to click anywhere on the screen, open or close applications, or access shut-down options.

                            <b> Solution 1 (Windows only):</b><br>
                            Restart Windows Explorer. To do this, press and hold Ctrl+Alt+Delete on your keyboard to open the Task
                            Manager. Next, locate and select Windows Explorer from the Processes tab and click Restart. You may need
                            to click More Details at the bottom of the window to see the Processes tab.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Solution 2 (Mac only):</b><br>
                            Restart Finder. To do this, press and hold Command+Option+Esc on your keyboard to open the Force Quit
                            Applications dialog box. Next, locate and select Finder, then click Relaunch.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Solution 3:</b><br>
                            Press and hold the Power button. The Power button is usually located on the front or side of the
                            computer, typically indicated by the power symbol. Press and hold the Power button for 5 to 10 seconds
                            to force the computer to shut down.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Solution 4:</b><br>
                            If the computer still won’t shut down, you can unplug the power cable from the electrical outlet. If
                            you’re using a laptop, you may be able to remove the battery to force the computer to turn off. Note:
                            This solution should be your last resort after trying the other suggestions above.

                            Try using a different power socket or, if you are using a power extension strip, plug the power cable
                            directly into a power socket in the wall.

                            Check if there are any lights on at the front of the machine:
                            If there are lights on the machine but not the monitor, then it’s probably a monitor issue.
                            If there are lights on the monitor but not the machine, then it’s probably a machine issue.
                            If there are no lights on anything, then it may be possible there is a local power cut.

                            With laptops, try removing the power cable and the battery. Hold down the power button for about ten
                            seconds, and then plug the battery and power cable in again. Press the power button to see if it
                            switches on.

                            more serious. Sometimes it is enough to have a little patience, but if the problem persists, do what we
                            propose below …
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete:</b><br>
                            A window will open where you can see the option to turn off the equipment or manage the tasks that are
                            being carried out at that time and may be interfering with the action of turning off the equipment.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds:</b><br>
                            If your computer crashes and does not respond for a long time, it is necessary to give a little push to
                            the force. A more extreme solution is to unplug the computer from the power (or remove its battery in
                            the case of laptops) although it is a solution not recommended for possible damage to the software or
                            loss of data.

                            In the power options section of your computer, you will find the behavior of the on and off button. Try
                            to choose the option that best suits you so that it does not suspend or turn off after a few minutes or
                            when you press the button.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Scan the PC for viruses:</b><br>
                            Sometimes a good antivirus that registers your entire PC can solve any problem that is causing this
                            computer failure. Also try to update the drivers of the computer in case any one is failing or uninstall
                            recently installed programs to find out if it is an application that is causing the problem.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Resets the system to factory settings:</b><br>
                            A virus, a momentary saturation of the equipment, a bad configuration in the system or a problem with a
                            program that is influencing the performance of the equipment can give failures as well. A simple
                            formatting or restoration of the system to an earlier point can solve any problem of a computer that
                            shuts down only constantly or does not shut down directly.

                            If the computer still does not respond, it is likely that your RAM, hard drive or any other component is
                            defective. Faced with this kind of common problems of a computer you will need to take it to a

                            of the internet modem can overload it.
                            In order to reset everything back to normal, simply switch off the modem, wait for few minutes and turn
                            it back on. You should be good to go in most cases.

                            weak. This can cause a slowdown—or, at minimum, a latency-filled browsing experience. In that case, you
                            may need to reposition, tweak, and boost your router with a few tricks.

                            Detect that you yourself are not self-sabotaging your computer or have security problems on the

                            that evil router that sometimes fails. Go pay him a visit and restart it. This way you will learn.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Free up space on your hard drive:</b><br>
                            Many times, we do not realize that we have overloaded the capacity of our team. Check that you have
                            enough gigabytes to function properly. Otherwise, you will have to uninstall a program that you do not

                            It is normal for you to have the problem that your computer shuts down on its own or runs slowly if it
                            overheats. Try to give it a little cool with a special fan for computers. Your circuits also need to be
                            aired from time to time. They may have been affected by the summer heat. If the temperature is too high
                            you can also clean it by opening it and cleaning the dust that has accumulated inside. Although for this
                            work, we advise you to contact a professional.

                            Sometimes, we don’t realize that these common computer problems can be solved by freeing up some disk
                            space. In the task manager of the Windows bar you can check which programs are consuming more energy. In
                            the Home tab, look at those applications that affect your performance and disable them. And if you don’t

                            components, but in the long run, you will have to change a new computer completely. Unfortunately,
                            nothing lasts forever, not even the machines, which also end up deteriorating.

                        <p class="para">It’s important to keep Windows 10 updated to ensure that your PC runs as well as possible, whilst also
                            being protected against the latest security threats. Even the best antivirus software won’t keep you
                            safe if your version of Windows is out of date. However, there are times when you may encounter a
                            problem when updating Windows 10.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the most common problems with Windows Update is when an update fails to install. You will usually
                            see an error message appear explaining that the update has not been successful. Most of the time, this
                            error message is quite good at explaining what the problem is and how to fix it, and one of the most
                            common reasons for Windows update not installing is incompatible software.
                            <br><br>
                            This means you may have an old version of an app or program that is preventing the Windows update to
                            install. If this is the case, the error message should explain which program is causing the issue.
                            Either uninstall the program which is causing the error, or visit the developer’s website to make sure
                            you have the latest version installed. Afterwards, try installing the update again.
                            <br><br>
                            Another reason why a Windows update may fail to install is due to a lack of hard drive space. Each
                            update requires a minimum amount of hard drive space to be available to install correctly, and if your
                            hard drive is too full, then the installation will fail. To fix this problem, free up hard drive space.
                            <br><br>
                            If you find that your computer is behaving erratically after installing a Windows update, then it could
                            be that the Windows update itself is causing the problem. To fix this, you will need to uninstall the
                            update. To do this type in “Windows update” into the Taskbar search box and select ‘Windows Update
                            settings‘. In the window that appears, click ‘View update history’. Then, select either ‘Uninstall
                            updates’ or ‘Recovery options’ and follow the steps to uninstall the problem update. Make sure you check
                            Microsoft’s support website to see if Microsoft has released a permanent fix for the problem update.

                            accessed or turned off — this is completely normal.

                            On the other hand, if you start hearing noises only occasionally or noises that you’ve never heard
                            before — like clicking, grinding, vibrations, or squealing — your hard drive may be failing.

                            <b> Make sure the sound comes from the hard drive</b><br>
                            Usually, when we hear the sound from our computers, it’s a hard drive sound. So when the sound suddenly
                            gets louder, we assume that it’s from the hard drive.
                            <br>
                            To check this, you can simply unplug the power and data cables from the hard drive and reboot the
                            system. If you still hear the sound, the issue is not with the hard drive.
                            <br><br>
                            <b></b>Run a diagnostic software</b><br>
                            If you’re certain that the sound comes from the hard drive itself, you can run a free hardware
                            diagnostic software which is already available on many computers or available on the internet.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Replace the hard drive</b><br>
                            If the diagnostic software fails, it simply means there is an issue related to the hardware of the
                            drive. If in that case, there is nothing you can do except to replace it.
                            Remember to make a back up of your files before replacing it.

                            The CPU fan can easily be stopped with a finger or debris since it does not have much torque. To prevent
                            the fan wiring from frying or any other damage, your fan will stop spinning even if you remove your
                            finger or the debris. Restart your computer to clear this error.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 2: </b><br>Clean your fan by blasting it with compressed air
                            Fans usually get clogged with dust. The buildup could reach the fan blades and prevent them from
                            spinning since these fans do not produce a lot of torque. You can disassemble your fan and clean it. If
                            you are not sure how to do that, get a can of compress air and blast it into the fan vents. Make sure
                            that your fan does not get to high RPMs (Revolutions per minute) since it may damage the fan.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 3:</b><br> Clear any wiring from the fan blades
                            Since CPU fans do not produce a lot of torque, wiring going into the fan motor can block the blades from
                            spinning. Take down your fan and make sure that there are no wires or anything going into the fan
                            blades. Secure the fan wiring onto the side using epoxy to ensure they do get in the way of the fan
                            blades.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 4:</b><br> Reset/Flash your BIOS
                            Your BIOS controls your fan. Resting it will clear any misconfigurations and get your fan working. To
                            reset the BIOS:
                            <br>
                            Shut down your PC
                            <br>
                            Press the power button and immediately press F2 to enter into BIOS setup
                            <br>
                            Press F9 (or the load defaults button shown on the BIOS screen) to reset your BIOS
                            <br>
                            Press Esc or F10 and select “save and Exit” press Enter and allow your system to restart then check if
                            the fan now works.
            
                            <br> You can also reset your BIOS by removing all power cables, battery, and removing the CMOS battery
                            and pressing the power button for at least 30 seconds.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 5:</b><br> Replace your fan
                            If you have tested your fan on another PC and it doesn’t work, or you have tested a known working fan on
                            your PC and it still doesn’t spin, then you will need to get a new fan. You should also ensure that you
                            are getting a 3-5V or 12V on the CPU fans terminals to avoid any doubt.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 6: </b><br>Replace your motherboard
                            The only sure way to know if your motherboard is the problem is to test a working CPU fan on your PC. If
                            it also doesn’t spin, then you will need to replace your motherboard. If you have electrical skills, you
                            can test if the CPU fan voltage output is between 3-5V or 12V. If there is no voltage or it is below 3V
                            then your computer is not able to supply enough power to run the fan. You will need to replace your
                            motherboard.
                            Make sure that your motherboard fits with your power supply unit and other components or you will have
                            extra costs replacing the other components too.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Method 7:</b><br> Replace your power supply unit
                            Replacing the motherboard is not usually a guarantee to solve this problem if you are on a desktop
                            computer. Since laptops integrate the PSU onto the motherboard, replacing the motherboard will fix the
                            problem. Desktop computers have a separate power supply unit that supplies 3V, 5V, 10V and 12V to your
                            motherboard. If the 5V or 12V supply is dead, your fan will not work. This will therefore need your to
                            replace the PSU.
                            <br>
                            You can tell that your PSU needs replacement when you get beeping sounds, or there is more than one
                            component that won’t work (your monitor, fan, USBs, keyboard, mouse) or the computer starts for a while
                            and then shuts down immediately.
                            <br>
                            Make sure that the PSU you are getting has similar supply ports with your replacement PSU otherwise they
                            will not be compatible.

                        <p class="para"> - Printer does not have power indicator
                            <br><br>
                            - First, make sure that the printer is turned on. When a printer is on, it should have some light or LED
                            (usually green) indicating it’s receiving power.
                            <br><br>
                            - If you do not have any indicator light, make sure the printer is connected to a working power outlet
                            by verifying each end of the power cable. Next, press the printer power button.
                            <br><br>
                            - If, after performing the above steps the printer still does not display a power status indicator
                            light, your printer may have a serious internal hardware issue. We suggest contacting the printer
                            manufacturer for repair or replacement.
                            <br><br>
                            - Cables not connected properly
                            <br><br>
                            - Your printer should have two cables connected to it: the power cable and the data cable. Make sure the
                            power and data cables (parallel cable or USB cable) are connected to both the printer and computer.
                            <br><br>
                            - Printer error (orange or blinking light)
                            <br><br>
                            - After your printer has completed its initial startup, you’ll see a solid colored light. If the
                            indicator is orange or blinking, often this is an indication of a printer error. A paper jam or an issue
                            with the ink or toner cartridge can cause the error.
                            <br><br>
                            - As there are not standards for all printers, if you see a blinking light, visit the manufacturer’s
                            website or review the printer manual for specific error details.
                            <br><br>
                            - No paper or paper jam
                            <br><br>
                            - Without paper, your printer cannot print. Make sure there is paper loaded into the printer paper
                            cartridge or tray. Next, verify that no printer paper is jammed or partially fed into the printer. If
                            you suspect paper is stuck somewhere it shouldn’t be, refer to our help page for paper jams.

                            - Inkjet printer ink related issues
                            <br><br>
                            - Often when you’re encountering an ink related issue, your printer status indicator light (mentioned
                            above) should be flashing. If this is not occurring, you may want to skip to the next section. However,
                            if you’ve recently inserted a new ink cartridge, you may want to try the below suggestions.
                            <br><br>
                            - Printer self-tests
                            <br><br>
                            - Most printers have a way of printing a test page. A printer test page allows you to determine if the
                            printer is working. The printer self-test is usually accomplished by holding down a series of keys. If
                            you don’t know to access and use the self-test feature on your printer, refer to the printer manual or
                            visit the printer manufacturer’s website.
                            <br><br>
                            - You can also perform a software self-test to determine if the computer can see the printer and it’s
                            able to print. Follow the steps below to perform this test.
                            <br><br>
                            - Open the Control Panel.
                            <br><br>
                            - Click or double-click the Printers, Printers and Fax, or Devices and Printers icon.
                            <br><br>
                            - Right-click on the printer you want to test and select the Properties or Printer Properties option. If
                            you do not see your printer listed, your printer is not installed.
                            <br><br>
                            - In the printer’s Properties window, click the Print Test Page button.
                            <br><br>
                            - If the printer can print a test page, your printer is installed and set up properly. However, if you
                            cannot print in other programs, the program you are attempting to print from likely has issues.

                        <p class="para"> • Sometimes your PC may not use a portion of RAM. For example, You may have 4GB of RAM, but your PC only
                            uses 2GB when you check it from the Task Manager. This is usually a Windows setting issue.
                            <br><br>
                            • Note: If only a few MBs (200-400MB) of RAM isn’t being utilized, then it’s probably being used by PC
                            hardware and you can’t do anything about it.
                            <br><br>
                            • The solution to this problem is simple – Windows must have been configured to only use a portion of
                            the RAM. Here is how to fix it:
                            <br><br>
                            • Press Windows + R keys and type msconfig in the Run dialog to open System Configurations.
                            <br><br>
                            • Move to Boot tab and click on Advanced options.
                            <br><br>
                            • Now check the checkbox next to Maximum memory and enter the maximum amount RAM you have installed (in
                            MBs).
                            <br><br>
                            • Click on OK and restart the PC to let it take effect.
                            <br><br>
                            • Good to know: While you are at it, you should also check the checkbox next to Number of processors
                            option and ensure your PC is utilizing all the CPU cores as well. Set it to the maximum number if you
                            want to use all of the CPU power.
                            <br><br>
                            • If this didn’t fix the problem, then there is also a chance one of the RAM isn’t installed properly.
                            Try reinstalling it.

                            If the PC doesn’t start after the beeps, then it’s usually difficult to solve the problem yourself.

                            <b> Problem 1: </b><br>Out of place RAM
                            If the RAM inside your PC gets loose or out of place, then your PC will beep 2-3 times and won’t boot at
                            all. The solution is simple, open up the PC (laptop users should let an expert handle this) and reinsert
                            the RAM. Here’s how:
                            <br><br>
                            Take out the RAM completely and clean any dirt inside the slot using a cotton bud.
                            <br><br>
                            Now insert back the RAM and put enough pressure on both ends to ensure it is fully inside.
                            <br><br>
                            Afterward, close the clips and make sure they’re properly locked. Even a slightly loose RAM will be
                            unable to work.

                            A damaged or wrongly installed hardware component could lead to beeps. Take out any newly added hardware
                            components and see if it solves the problem. If the PC works fine afterward, then either get it
                            installed properly or get it fixed (or replaced).

                            leave your PC unprotected because Windows Defender Antivirus will kick in if no other antivirus software
                            is running.

                        <p class="para">The dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) can occur due to both software and hardware problems, but
                            usually, it’s a hardware problem. Whatever the cause, BSOD requires immediate attention as it’s a sign
                            of a big problem.
                            <br><br>
                            BlueScreenView is a great Nirsoft utility that will show important information if you have recently
                            suffered a Blue Screen of Death. You should be able to identify and solve the problem using this
                            information. Below are some common reasons for BSOD and their solutions.
                            <br><br>
                           <b>Corrupted drivers</b> <br>
                            • A corrupt driver may be the cause of BSOD. To find that out, use the following steps:
                            <br>
                            • Open Device Manager by typing devmgmt.msc in the Run.
                            <br>
                            • Here expand each menu and look for a yellow triangle icon next to each driver.
                            <br>
                            • If you find any, right-click on it and select Update Driver Software to update its driver.
                            <br>
                            • You can also use a third-party app like IObit Driver Booster to automatically find and fix driver
                            problems.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>   Too much pressure on the RAM</b> <br>
                            • If you open too many programs that RAM can’t handle, then it may freeze the system and show BSOD. For
                            that, you should either stop opening too many programs or upgrade the RAM.
            
                            </p>
